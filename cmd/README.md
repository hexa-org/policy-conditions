# Hexa Executables

This directory contains executable go packages (have a main function). In particular, the hexa directory
contains the [Hexa Administration CLI](../docs/HexaAdmin.md).

The Hexa CLI is based on the [Kong parser](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong) which is used to build up the Hexa shell 
and command structure.

# AWS Cedar Parser based on Participle - Deprecated

This directory contains a parser/mapper for the original published version of Amazon Cedar Policy Language
It uses the [Participle parser from Alec Thomas](github.com/alecthomas/participle/v2).  

This mapper has been replaced by an [implementation](../cedar) based on [Cedar-go](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-go).
